    "reasoning": "The spacing between the product cards is incorrect. In the incorrect design, the cards are placed too close together, making the layout feel compressed. The correct design shows more spacing between the items in the grid layout. The issue is with the 'gap' property in the '.cardsGrid' class, which is currently set to '1px'. This should be increased to '32px' to match the correct design.",
