    "reasoning": "Looking at the two designs, there's a difference in the spacing between the product image and the product info. In the correct design, there's more space between the product image and the text below it. In the incorrect design, the product information appears too close to the image. The CSS property that needs to be fixed is likely the padding-top value in the card__productInfo class.",
