    "reasoning": "Looking at the two screenshots, I can see that the main difference is in the content width. In the incorrect version, the text spans across the full width of the content area, whereas in the correct version, the text appears to be more constrained with a maximum width. The lookbook__content section in the incorrect design has 'max-width: auto' which is an invalid value (auto is not valid for max-width). In the correct version, this section likely has a specific pixel width to constrain the text.",
