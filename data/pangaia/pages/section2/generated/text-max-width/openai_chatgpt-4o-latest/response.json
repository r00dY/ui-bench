    "reasoning": "The incorrect design has a title with a line-height that is too large, causing excessive spacing between lines. The correct design shows a more compact title with less space between lines. The issue comes from the `.lookbook__title` class, where the `line-height` is set too high. Adjusting it to `1.2` from `1.4` will match the correct design.",
