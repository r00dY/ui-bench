    "reasoning": "When comparing the two designs, I notice that the main difference is in the font family used for the paragraphs. In the incorrect version, the paragraphs are using 'HW Cigars' font which creates a mismatch with the design aesthetic and makes the text appear more stylized. In the correct version, the paragraphs appear to be using a more standard sans-serif font, likely 'PANGAIA' which would be more appropriate for body text and easier to read. The font for the paragraph text needs to be changed from 'HW Cigars' to 'PANGAIA'.",
