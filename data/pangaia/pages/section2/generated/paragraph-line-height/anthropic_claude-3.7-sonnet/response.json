    "reasoning": "Looking at the two screenshots, the main difference is in the typography. In the incorrect design, the paragraph text appears to be using the 'HW Cigars' font, while in the correct design, it appears to be using 'PANGAIA' font instead. The lookbook__paragraph class appears to have the incorrect font-family value of 'HW Cigars' which should be changed to 'PANGAIA'.",
