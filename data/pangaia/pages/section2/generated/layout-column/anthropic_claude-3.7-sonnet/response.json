    "reasoning": "Looking at the differences between the incorrect and correct designs, I can see that the layout is different. In the incorrect design, the content (text) is stacked below the image in a vertical layout. In the correct design, the image and content are positioned side by side in a horizontal layout. The lookbook section needs to be displayed as a row instead of a column. This suggests that the flex-direction property of the .lookbook class needs to be changed from 'column' to 'row'.",
