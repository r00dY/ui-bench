    "reasoning": "The incorrect page shows the title text ('Spring Lookbook: A New Season in Balance') appearing smaller than in the correct design. This suggests that the font size of the '.lookbook__title' element is incorrect. Comparing both images, the correct design appears to have a larger title size, indicating the need to increase the current font-size value from 48px to 64px.",
