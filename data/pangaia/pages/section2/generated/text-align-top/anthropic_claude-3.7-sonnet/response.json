    "reasoning": "When comparing the incorrect and correct designs, I notice the main difference is in the font family used for the paragraph text. In the incorrect version, the paragraphs use 'HW Cigars' serif font, while in the correct version, they appear to be using the 'PANGAIA' font. The text should look cleaner and more modern, matching the brand identity. The font family for the lookbook__paragraph class needs to be changed from 'HW Cigars' to 'PANGAIA'.",
