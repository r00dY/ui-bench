    "reasoning": "Comparing the incorrect and correct designs, I notice the main difference is in the container width. In the incorrect version, the container takes up the full width of the page with 'max-width: auto', while in the correct version, the container appears to have a specific maximum width that centers the content. The value 'auto' is invalid for max-width and should be replaced with a pixel value to constrain the width.",
