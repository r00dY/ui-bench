    "reasoning": "The difference between the incorrect and correct designs is the spacing between the images. In the incorrect design, the images are tightly packed with no gaps, whereas in the correct design, there are visible spaces between the images.

To fix this, we need to update the 'gap' property to match the correct design.",
