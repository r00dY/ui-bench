    "reasoning": "Looking at both screenshots, I can see that the only visual difference is in the blur effect applied to the banner background. In the incorrect version, the backdrop-filter blur effect on the bannerCentered__content is too strong (1px), making the background look too clear. The correct version appears to have a stronger blur effect that creates a more subtle, smooth appearance.",
