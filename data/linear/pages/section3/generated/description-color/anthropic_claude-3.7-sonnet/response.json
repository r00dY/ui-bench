    "reasoning": "When comparing the two screenshots, I notice that the background blur effect is different between the incorrect and correct versions. In the incorrect version, the blur effect appears to be too strong, making the background less visible. Looking at the CSS code, I found that the 'backdrop-filter: blur(1px)' value in the '.bannerCentered__content' class is what needs to be modified. The value should be reduced to create a subtler blur effect that matches the correct design.",
