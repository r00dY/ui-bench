    "reasoning": "The background blur effect appears to be weaker in the incorrect design compared to the correct design. The issue is caused by the 'backdrop-filter' property in the '.bannerCentered__content' class. It is currently set to 'blur(1px)', which is not strong enough to create the desired depth effect as seen in the correct design. Increasing the blur intensity will match the correct design.",
