    "reasoning": "The incorrect design shows that the background blur effect is weaker compared to the correct design. Specifically, the blur effect for the .bannerCentered__backgroundBlur element appears less intense, making the text stand out less. The issue is caused by an insufficient blur amount in the filter property.",
