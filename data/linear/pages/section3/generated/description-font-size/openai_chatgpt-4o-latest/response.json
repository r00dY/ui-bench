    "reasoning": "The incorrect design appears to have a weaker background blur effect compared to the correct design. The blur effect in 'incorrect.html' is too subtle, making the background appear sharper and less diffused. The main issue is the 'filter: blur(140px);' value in '.bannerCentered__backgroundBlur'. In the correct design, the blur is stronger, making the background appear more diffused. The value should be increased to 'filter: blur(200px);' to match the correct design.",
