    "reasoning": "Looking at both screenshots, I notice that the background blur effect seems different between the incorrect and correct versions. In the incorrect version, the blur effect may be too weak. The 'backdrop-filter: blur(1px)' on the '.bannerCentered__content' element appears to be the issue. This value should likely be higher to match the correct design, which seems to have a stronger blur effect.",
