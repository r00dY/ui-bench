    "reasoning": "Comparing the two screenshots, the main visible difference is in the background blur effect. In the incorrect version (first screenshot), the background gradient is more visible with a blurry blue effect, while in the correct version (second screenshot), this blur effect appears to have a different opacity. Looking at the CSS, the issue is likely in the '.bannerCentered__backgroundBlur' class where the opacity value needs to be adjusted to match the correct design.",
