    "reasoning": "The incorrect design has a backdrop blur that is too weak compared to the correct design. The current blur effect applied to the `.bannerCentered__content` is `backdrop-filter: blur(1px)`, which results in a barely noticeable effect. In the correct design, the blur is more prominent, likely around `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`. Adjusting this value will match the correct design.",
