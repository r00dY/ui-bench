    "reasoning": "Comparing the incorrect and correct designs, I can see that in the 'correct' version, the primary button ('Get started') is purple, while in the 'incorrect' version, it's using the same color as defined in the .buttonLink class (which is #5e6ad2). The buttonLink--primary class is mentioned in the HTML but doesn't have specific styling in the CSS. We need to add styling to distinguish the primary button from the secondary one.",
