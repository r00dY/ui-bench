    "reasoning": "When comparing the two images, I notice that the buttons in the incorrect version have a different height. The buttons in the incorrect version appear taller than the ones in the correct version. The 'height' property of the '.buttonLink' class is set to 28px in the incorrect version, which makes the buttons too tall compared to the correct design. The buttons in the correct design appear to have a more standard height that would better fit the design.",
