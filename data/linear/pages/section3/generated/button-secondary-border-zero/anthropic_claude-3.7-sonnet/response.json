    "reasoning": "After comparing both images, I notice that the background blur effect is different between the incorrect and correct designs. In the incorrect design, the backdrop-filter for the bannerCentered__content element is set to blur(1px), which is causing a slight blur over the entire content area. In the correct design, there is no visible blur over the content. Therefore, the backdrop-filter property value needs to be changed from 1px to 0 or removed entirely.",
