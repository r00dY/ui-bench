    "reasoning": "Looking at both screenshots, I notice that the background blur effect appears stronger in the correct image while it seems to have lower opacity or intensity in the incorrect version. This suggests the issue is with the blur filter value or opacity in the .bannerCentered__backgroundBlur class. In the incorrect version, the blur filter is set to 1px for the .bannerCentered__content, but the actual blur issue is in the .bannerCentered__backgroundBlur element which has a blur value of 140px.",
