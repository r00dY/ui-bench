    "reasoning": "The key difference between the incorrect and correct designs is the positioning of the content in the banner. In the incorrect version, the text content (.banner__content) is positioned at the bottom of the banner. In the correct version, the text content is positioned more toward the top/middle of the image. This is controlled by the 'top' property in the .banner__content selector. Currently, it's set to 'auto', which is causing it to default to the bottom positioning (since 'bottom: 0' is also specified). The 'top' property needs to be changed to position the content correctly.",
