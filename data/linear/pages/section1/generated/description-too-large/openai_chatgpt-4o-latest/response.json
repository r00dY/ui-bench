    "reasoning": "The text inside the .banner__content section appears to be misaligned in the incorrect design. The issue is with the 'align-items' property, which is set to 'left', but 'left' is not a valid value for 'align-items'. In the correct design, the text is properly aligned to the left, which means the correct property value should be 'flex-start'.",
