    "reasoning": "Comparing the two screenshots, the main difference is in the position of the banner content. In the incorrect version, the text content appears to be at the bottom of the image, whereas in the correct version, the content is properly positioned at the bottom of the banner. The issue appears to be with the 'top' property in the '.banner__content' class. It's currently set to 'auto', which is causing the content to be positioned at the bottom. It should be set to a specific value to match the correct design.",
