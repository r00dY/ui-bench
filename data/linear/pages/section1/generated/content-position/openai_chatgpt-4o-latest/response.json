    "reasoning": "The text content inside the `.banner__content` section is positioned too high in the incorrect design compared to the correct reference. The issue is caused by the `top` property being set to `0`. To correct the alignment, it should be updated to `auto` and the `bottom` property should be set to `40px` so that the content aligns with the lower part of the banner as seen in the correct design.",
