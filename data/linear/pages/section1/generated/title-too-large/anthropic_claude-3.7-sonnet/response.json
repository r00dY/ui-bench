    "reasoning": "Looking at the differences between the incorrect and correct designs, I notice that in the incorrect design, the banner content (title and description) is positioned at the bottom of the image while in the correct design it should be positioned lower, directly on the dark background. The issue appears to be with the 'top: auto' value in the .banner__content class, which is keeping the content attached to the bottom of the image rather than placing it at the correct position on the page.",
