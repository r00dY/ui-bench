    "reasoning": "The incorrect design shows that the text content inside '.banner__content' is misaligned to the left. The CSS property 'align-items' currently has the value 'left', which is an invalid value for flexbox alignment. The correct value should be 'flex-start' to properly align the text to the left while maintaining correct spacing and formatting.",
