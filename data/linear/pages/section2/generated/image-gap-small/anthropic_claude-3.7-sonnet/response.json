    "reasoning": "Looking at the incorrect vs. correct design, the main difference is in the spacing between the images and the titles. In the incorrect design, there appears to be no margin between the card__image and the card__title elements. In the correct design, there is visible spacing between the images and the titles. This suggests that the margin-bottom value for the card__image class needs to be increased.",
