    "reasoning": "The main difference between the incorrect and correct designs is that in the correct design, there is a vertical divider line between the two cards. In the incorrect design, this divider is missing. Looking at the CSS, the issue is with the .card--first class where the border-right-style is set to 'none' instead of 'solid'. This property needs to be changed to create the vertical divider line that should separate the two cards.",
