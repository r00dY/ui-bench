    "reasoning": "Comparing the incorrect and correct designs, I notice three main differences: 1) The padding top and bottom of the twoCards container is different - the incorrect version has 0px padding while the correct one has more vertical spacing. 2) The padding-top and padding-bottom of the card class appears too small in the incorrect version. 3) The spacing between the card's image and the title text appears to be different - the margin-bottom on the card__image seems too large in the incorrect version.",
