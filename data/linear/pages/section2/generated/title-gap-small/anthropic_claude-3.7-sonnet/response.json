    "reasoning": "Comparing the incorrect and correct design screenshots, I noticed that the main difference is in the vertical spacing between the cards' content and the top/bottom sections. In the incorrect design, there's no padding between the cards and the borders. The issue is with the 'twoCards' class where the padding-top and padding-bottom values are set to 0px. In the correct design, there appears to be appropriate spacing above and below the card content.",
