    "reasoning": "Looking at the differences between the incorrect and correct designs, I can see two issues: 1) In the incorrect design, there's no vertical divider line separating the two cards. This suggests that the border-right on the first card is missing or not visible. 2) The images in the cards appear to be too small and don't properly fill their container width. The correct version shows the images taking up the full width of their containers.",
