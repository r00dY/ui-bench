    "reasoning": "The logo text for 'Glossier.' appears in an italicized font in the incorrect design, whereas it should be in a normal (non-italic) style as seen in the correct design. The issue comes from the incorrect font-weight or font-style being applied to the `.header__logo` class. Fixing this by changing the font-style to normal will match the correct design.",
