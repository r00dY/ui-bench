    "reasoning": "Looking at the differences between the incorrect and correct designs, I noticed that in the incorrect design, the notification bar shows pause controls (||) positioned to the right of 'Terms apply.' However, in the correct design, these pause controls appear at the far right edge of the notification bar. This suggests that the justification of the notification bar content needs to be adjusted to create proper spacing between the text and the controls.",
