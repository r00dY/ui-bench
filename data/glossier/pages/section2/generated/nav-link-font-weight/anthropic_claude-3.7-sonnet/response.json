    "reasoning": "When comparing the two screenshots, I notice that in both the incorrect and correct designs, the header layout appears similar with the black notification bar at the top followed by the main navigation. The key difference I can see is with the links in the header. In the incorrect design, the header links are too small, making them appear condensed and hard to read. The correct design shows larger, more legible text for the navigation links. This suggests the font size for the header links needs to be increased.",
