    "reasoning": "When comparing the incorrect and correct designs, I notice that the line height for the reviewBanner__description is different. In the incorrect design, the text 'Your favorite scents that will grow with you no matter where you are in your personal evolution' appears to be displayed with a line height of 1 (single spacing), making the text compressed. In the correct design, the same text has a more appropriate line height with natural spacing between lines, making it more readable. The line-height property for .reviewBanner__description needs to be increased from 1 to 1.4.",
