    "reasoning": "The incorrect design has a border on only the right and bottom sides of the button, making it look incomplete. In the correct design, the button has a full border on all four sides. The issue is caused by `border-top-width: 0;` and `border-left-width: 0;`, which remove the top and left borders. These values should be modified to `1px` to ensure a consistent border around the button.",
