    "reasoning": "Comparing the incorrect and correct designs, I can see that the main difference is in the layout of the review text. In the incorrect version, the review text (reviewBanner__reviewText) has a max-width of 220px, which causes the text to wrap into many narrow lines. In the correct version, the text flows more naturally across the available space without this constraint. The max-width restriction in the incorrect version is causing the undesired narrow text column in the review section.",
