    "reasoning": "The 'Shop now' button has an incorrect border configuration. The incorrect design only applies a border to the right and bottom, while the correct design should have a border on all sides. This issue is caused by explicitly setting 'border-top-width' and 'border-left-width' to 0. To fix this, we need to update these values to match the right and bottom border thickness.",
