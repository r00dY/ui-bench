    "reasoning": "Looking at the two screenshots, the main visual difference is the width of the content column. In the incorrect version, the text content (your fragrances, description, review) seems to take up more horizontal space than in the correct version. This suggests that the grid layout needs adjustment. The correct design shows that the left column (reviewBanner__content) should be narrower with the image on the right taking more space. The grid template columns value needs to be modified to make the left column narrower.",
