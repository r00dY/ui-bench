    "reasoning": "The incorrect design has the button with a partial border on the top and left sides missing, causing it to appear incomplete. The correct design has a full border around the button. The issue is caused by 'border-top-width' and 'border-left-width' set to 0 in the '.buttonLink' class. Updating these values to match the border on the right and bottom will fix the design issue.",
