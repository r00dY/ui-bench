    "reasoning": "When comparing the two designs, I notice that in the incorrect version, the content box (hero__content) appears to be positioned differently. In the correct design, the hero__content box is positioned at the left edge of the page without any margin, while in the incorrect version, it has some spacing from the left edge. Looking at the CSS, this is controlled by the 'left' property of the .hero__content class, which is currently set to '16px'. This value needs to be changed to '0' to match the correct design.",
