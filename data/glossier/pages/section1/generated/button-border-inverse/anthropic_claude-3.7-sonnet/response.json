    "reasoning": "Comparing the incorrect and correct designs, I notice that the 'Shop now' button looks different. In the incorrect version, the button has a solid background color (#e8e8e8) and appears as a filled button. In the correct version, the button has a transparent background and is styled as an outlined button with borders. The only CSS value that needs to be changed is the background-color of the .buttonLink class from '#e8e8e8' to 'transparent'.",
