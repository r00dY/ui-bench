    "reasoning": "The difference between the incorrect and correct designs is the appearance of the 'Shop now' button. In the incorrect version, the button has a different background color (#e8e8e8) which gives it a grey background. In the correct version, the button appears to have a transparent/white background to match the content box. The styling issue is with the background-color property of the buttonLink class.",
