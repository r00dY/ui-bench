    "reasoning": "Looking at both designs, I noticed that in the incorrect version, the font family for the hero__title is set to 'sans-serif' instead of 'Apercu'. This causes the title 'Milky Jelly Cleansing Balm' to appear in a generic sans-serif font rather than the Apercu font that's used throughout the rest of the page. The correct version shows all text using the Apercu font family, creating a consistent typographic design.",
