    "reasoning": "The 'hero__logo' element in the incorrect design is positioned too low, partially covering the text content. Comparing it to the correct design, the logo should be positioned closer to the image without overlapping the content. The issue is caused by the 'bottom' value being set to '-16px' in the incorrect CSS. It needs to be adjusted to '0' to correctly position the logo.",
