    "reasoning": "The main visual difference between the incorrect and correct designs is the appearance of the 'Shop now' button. In the incorrect design, the button has a border on the right and bottom sides, which gives it a slightly offset appearance. In the correct design, the button has borders on all four sides, creating a more traditional button look with a complete border. This suggests that the border-left-width and border-top-width values need to be updated in the .buttonLink class.",
